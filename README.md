# Bachelor Thesis Appendix

This repository contains all supplementary materials for the thesis on stochastic choice behavior.

## Contents

- `Decision-Making Behavior Research Questionnaire*.csv`: Raw survey responses exported from Google Forms.  
- `clean_beta_output.csv`: Cleaned behavioral data used for model estimation.  
- `Simulation_Results.csv`: Output of model simulations.  
- `all_model_results.csv`: Summary of model fit results across conditions.

## Code Scripts

- `simulated_data_thesis.py`: Main analysis script using simulated data to fit models, evaluate empirical performance, and generate figures.
- `bachelor_thesis_analysis_code.py`: Main analysis script using real experimental data to fit models, evaluate empirical performance, and generate figures.

## Requirements

Python 3.8+ with the following packages:
- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- scipy
- sklearn
## Notes

The original questionnaire was implemented using Google Forms and contained randomized binary choice tasks across three behavioral conditions (indifference, indecisiveness, and experimentation). The raw responses were exported in CSV format and anonymized prior to analysis.

## Questionnaire Access

The original survey was created using Google Forms and designed to test stochastic choice behavior under three conditions: indifference, indecisiveness, and experimentation.
